#### Notes from "A Programmer's Guide to English"

Today we read the guide-- A Programmers Guide to English. This guide is ideal for individuals, especially programmers, looking to gain a structured, long-term strategy for mastering English. It dismisses quick fixes and focuses on understanding the nature of language learning through a systematic, personalized approach. And we took some notes as follows:

---

**Target Audience:**  
- The guide is tailored for individuals, particularly programmers, aiming to master English.
- It is especially useful for those with a basic or poor foundation in English, often finding generic online tips ineffective.

**Guide Purpose & Approach:**  
- The guide emphasizes a long-term, realistic approach to learning English, steering clear of quick-fix methods.
- It advises deep understanding of language learning principles and suggests custom strategies based on individual needs.

**Key Insights:**
1. **Language Learning Basics:**  
   - Language is a tool for exchanging consciousness and knowledge, not the only way to communicate.
   - Mastery of language allows for more efficient and accurate communication.
   
2. **Misleading Learning Methods:**  
   - Casual tips like "watch more TV shows" may work for advanced learners but not for beginners.
   - It’s crucial to select learning methods appropriate for your current level to avoid wasting time.

3. **Essence of Learning a Language:**
   - Learning a language involves acquiring both the means of expression and the cognitive patterns that native speakers use.
   - Translation-based thinking is discouraged as it slows down communication.

4. **No Shortcuts:**  
   - Learning a language takes time—months or years, not days or weeks. Anyone promising quick results is likely misleading.
   - Consistency, practice, and adaptation are essential for success.

**Programmers' Perspective on Learning:**  
1. The guide uses analogies familiar to programmers, like constructing a program to recognize and process language.
2. Learning English is broken down into components like "input recognition" (listening and reading) and "output generation" (speaking and writing), akin to designing a system for language processing.

**Practical Methods:**
1. **Benchmark Your Skills:**  Set measurable goals like passing an English proficiency exam (IELTS, TOEFL) to understand your current abilities and set clear targets.
   
2. **Consistent Exposure:**  Engage with English daily—set your device languages to English, consume English content, and practice writing in English to make progress.

**October 9 Reading: Starting from Scratch to Learn English Grammar**

We began with the basics of grammar, starting with parts of speech and sentence components.

--------------

#### Sentence Structure: Subject, Verb, and Object

For example: *I hit you.*

The sentence can be broken down as follows:
- *I* (Subject)
- *hit* (Verb)
- *you* (Object)

Each of these components has a corresponding part of speech. Today, we will focus on the ten parts of speech.

**Understanding the Relationship Between Sentences, Sentence Components, and Parts of Speech**

Words, relative to sentence components, are like building blocks. Every sentence component is made up of one or more words, and each word has a specific part of speech.

Now, what are these ten parts of speech? We divide them into three categories.

**Non-essential Parts of Speech:**

1. **Pronoun**: This replaces a noun, as the word *pro-noun* suggests: pronoun = pro（代替） + noun（名词）代名词的词。
2. **Numeral**: As the name implies, these are words related to numbers, like "one, two, three."
3. **Interjection**: Words used to express emotions, often standing apart from the syntactical structure.

**Essential Parts of Speech:**

1. **Noun**: Refers to names of things, both concrete and abstract.
2. **Verb**: Denotes actions or states.
3. **Adjective**: Describes or modifies a noun.
4. **Adverb**: Modifies adjectives, verbs, or other adverbs, typically providing information about time, place, manner, or degree.

These four fundamental parts of speech share intricate relationships.

**Function Words (Particles):**

In addition to these core components, sentences require function words, which often serve as connectors or provide structure. There are three key types:
1. **Prepositions**: Words that indicate relationships between nouns and other elements of the sentence.
2. **Conjunctions**: Words that link phrases, clauses, or sentences.
3. **Articles**: Words placed before nouns to clarify whether the noun is definite or indefinite.

Thus, sentence components often correlate with specific parts of speech, allowing us to create a framework for understanding sentence structure.

---

#### Eight Sentence Components

Having grasped the relationship between grammar's three main elements (sentences, sentence components, and parts of speech), we can now examine sentence components in more detail.

What Are Sentence Components?

Sentence components are the building blocks of sentences, and there are eight in total.

To better understand them, let's consider a simple analogy with a story.

- **Subject**: The main character or doer of the action in the sentence, similar to the protagonist in a story. For example, *Zhanhuwei* as the subject.
- **Predicate**: The action or state that the subject is engaged in. In our example, *Zhanhuwei* performs the action of *hugging*.
- **Object**: The entity affected by the subject's action. In our example, the *girl* being hugged by Zhanhuwei is the object.

These form the basic structure of a sentence. But a sentence can be further enhanced with:
- **Attributes**: Modifiers that describe the subject, like "ornaments" on the main character. These are adjectives or other descriptive elements.
- **Adverbials**: Provide context by indicating time, place, reason, etc. They are like the background setting of a story, describing where or when the action takes place.

Finally, two more components complete the picture:
- **Complement**: Provides additional information about the subject or object, completing the meaning of the sentence. For example, in "*Zhanhuwei* stood alone," *alone* serves as a complement to the subject.
- **Appositive**: Restates or explains the subject or object in different terms. For example, in "*the other man, tall and handsome,*" *tall and handsome* is an appositive.

---

#### Five Essential Sentence Structures

English grammar can seem intimidating, but breaking it down into manageable parts helps. At the core are five basic sentence structures, which serve as the foundation for all complex sentences.

##### 1. Subject + Verb (SV)
This is the simplest sentence structure, with a subject performing an action. For example, "*He sleeps.*"

##### 2. Subject + Verb + Object (SVO)
Here, the action affects another object, as in "*He killed him.*"

##### 3. Subject + Verb + Complement (SVC)
In this structure, the verb is often a linking verb (e.g., *is, seems*), and the complement provides more information about the subject. For example, "*He is smart.*"

##### 4. Subject + Verb + Indirect Object + Direct Object (SVOO)
In this case, the verb affects both a direct and indirect object, as in "*She gave me a gift.*"

##### 5. Subject + Verb + Object + Complement (SVOC)
Finally, this structure provides additional details about the object. For example, "*They made me happy.*"

Mastering these basic structures allows us to understand more complex sentence forms.

---

#### Adjectives and Their Relationship with Nouns

Adjectives and nouns have a close relationship. In English, adjectives typically precede the noun they modify, as in "a beautiful flower."

When multiple adjectives modify a noun, they follow a specific order. Opinion adjectives come before descriptive adjectives. For example:
- "A lovely old Italian car."

Certain adjectives, when modifying pronouns, are placed after the noun, such as:
- "Someone special."

---

#### Adverbs

Adverbs modify adjectives, verbs, and even other adverbs. They often end in *-ly*, though some adverbs, like *fast* or *hard*, don't follow this pattern. When used with verbs, adverbs generally follow the verb, though their placement can change to avoid ambiguity.

For example:
- "*He kissed her tenderly.*" Here, the adverb *tenderly* follows the verb.

However, in some cases, the adverb may be placed before the verb for clarity:
- "*He tenderly kissed her.*"

---

#### Prepositions: In, On, At

Prepositions indicate relationships between nouns and other elements, particularly regarding time or location. For instance:
- *In* indicates being inside something (e.g., *in the room*).
- *On* refers to being on a surface (e.g., *on the table*).
- *At* refers to a specific point or location (e.g., *at the station*).

---

#### Comparatives

When making comparisons, adjectives or adverbs are modified to show a difference between two things. For example:
- "*He is taller than me.*"

It is important to ensure that comparisons are clear, especially when referring to different subjects. For example:
- "*I love you more than he does*" (to clarify that the comparison is between two people loving you).
