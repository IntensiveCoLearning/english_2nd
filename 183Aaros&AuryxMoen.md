  - Dictation: There's been considerable rocket fire between Israel and Hisblind(?)*Hezbollah* Lebanon in recent days. Thousands*Dozens* of rockets have been fired into northern Israel by Halbala(?)*Hezbollah* and it's been significant damage done by Israeli strikes in Lebanon. This strategy*footage* is from? Yaroun and in the southwest*south-west *of* Lebenan? you can see buildings have been flattened in*over* a large area. 
    We've been mapping the way to the *the wider* picture too. If you focus on the region, this map is based on data from the Institute of Study of War,*.* It's up to date as of Monday morning,
    so it doesn't include the most recent strikes. It doesn't include reported strikes  xxx*.We haven't* verified them all, and they*there* maybe some we don't know about? But you can see here in pop on *purple* recent herespak(?) *Hezbollah*
    attack on Israel*.* and in red you can see Israeli strikes in Lebanon. This focuses on a few examples to show the extent of the damage you can see in Lebanon. 
    Firstly this one is from Arab Saline(?)*Arabsalim* in southern Lebanon 16 kilometers from the border of*with* Israel. We verify this footage by looking at the surrounding area and*.It* matching satellite images from 
    the for(?) *before* the rate *this raid* and building still standing in this footage. And we're confident the footage is from Tuesday morning when it was first posted online. What we *it* clearly sure *shows* is that *a* considerable level of damage.
    Let me also show you this footage from Berrod(?) *Beirut* . Israel says it's targeting hesbalad(?) *Hezbollah* 's stronghold, particular areas of weapons are been *being* stored. And this footage does appear to show secondary explosions.
    You can hear, there's already damage done, the building is on fire, and about 40 seconds into the footage which has been posted online, there's another explosion. *A* projectile flies up (?) the building, *and* that's
    lately? *likely* caused by ammunition blowing up. There are other examples like this. We're *'ve* shown *them* to experts, who see again this is likely called by ammunition exploding. With damages against the backdrop
    Israel is sending more troops into Lebanon. On Tuesday Israeli defense forces confirmed they were expanding the operations into the southwest. And like what's happening in Gaza, this is a sort of warning
    circulated by the IDF. This one in Arabic tells people in the south to be careful not to move south, and it tells many not to return to their homes for their own safety. 
    In recent months, hundreds of thousands of people in Lebanon have been displaced and much of that has been happening in the south of the country. Where we've seen a lot of the damage too.

  -Dictation: Why are these maps renamed in southern U.S.A. in Lebanon and Ukraine spreading online? It's all to do with a claim the white house prioritising the funding for these countries of America affected by Hurricane kalin*Katrina* and Milton. Former senator Rick Scott posted on X "If we renamed Florida and North Carolina to Lebanon and Ukraine maybe Kamala Harris would send disaster relief faster". And former President Donald Trump weighed in this claim: "They have no funds to take care of that, they have no funds, they have no workers, they have no nothing". So what are the facts? The U.S. government confirmed last week it will provide more humanitarian relief to people in Lebanon and *another* 150m dollars, and it has given a lot of money to Ukraine, around 100 billion dollars to start*since the start* a*of the* full-scale war against Russia. But Fema(?) an*the* department for responsible for responding to events in the U.S like carocaines(?)*Hurricanes* has dedicated to disaster relief budget. It said*says* it has 11 billion left of that for the rest of this year. The agency has appealed for the*/* more funding for future hurricanes a*and* warn*warned* of *a* lack of staff. But instead*it insists* it has enough resources to meet immediate needs. "I have enough funding to get through this event and support all of the needs of everyone that was impacted by Hurricane Hellin(?)*Helene* and Hurricane Milton(?) from*and* what we expect from Milton(?)". What elses*The White Houses has* pushing back on claims as*/* it *hasn't* provided funds quickly enough of*in* the aftermath *of* Hurricane Milton which delesgate*devastated*

  -Dictation: So Donald Trump, not you Republican says he wants to seal the border, nobody in. Is that something you support? So I believe when the president says that um to secure our literal border to ensure the agenda the Americans sacrety as a nation not to ... yes yes that doesn't mean ... that means to secure the literal border. "You're seeing it in anything else". Even the immigration has been immigration of undocumented or legal marks has been so much harron(?) average under the Biden administration 2 milinuim(?) years compared with the Trump administration in about 300..400 thousand years. Are you blaming that all on a bill when it is supposed to be the past what about the previous 3 years? To get to a ... to a place where we have orderly border security that we deserve it is gonna take an act of the Congress and the Congress had the bill on the table that is not locked because of one man named Donald Trump he said to blame them and I do.

  - Dictation: "We have lift off". Starship is the largest powerful rocket *ever* built *and* today it made history the *.The* first and second stages separated. Normally, the lowest stage pulls away, *but* in this case, something amazing happened. It did a little back lip *flip* , and then pinned downwards to (?) *towards* the launchpad, and then as it approached to supersonic speed engines to dawn(?) *turned on* to slow it down. As it approach *approached* closer most of the engines would then turned off so they can gentally come towards the pad and then come towards a *the* giant arms that cloated, and what's called the "chopsticks" manuver *manoeuvre*. It's increadibly difficult. So many things could gone wrong, and this was the first time that anyone could have tried it. Somehow, they managed to get it right first time if he could patch pits(?) the *catch bits of* rocket and reuse them, the idea, is to reduce the cost of space exloration, an hour after the launch we saw the top section re-entered the earth atmostphere and then splashing down in the Indian Ocean. The plan is to re-use that portion as well, once they found out how to do it perfectly. Space-X has rebuilt to send astranaut *astronauts* to the moon, N.A.S.A want to go back and stay on the moon, maybe on tvalt(?) *onto Mars* . On call that *And for that* they need a different types of spacecraft. The plan is for starship to be so big that it could take up to 100 astraunauts *astronauts* onboard and *.

  - Dictation: Inflation has been coming down, and now interest rates are coming down. There are *is* some uncertain in geopolitical events around the world. We don't know what is happening in Ukraine and the Middle-East, is now a good time to invest? Are you telling your investors now pull *pour* money into the market because inflation is coming down *investor* and interest rates are coming down? Will *or do* you tell them to wait until *till after* the presidential election? For example, if we look at the last couple of years, you have very high rates on cash, you can make 5% with very little risks on treasury bills, money market funds. That's really unusual as a result of that, money market funds at all time highs 6.7 trillion dollars, if you think about that, that's very good for saver and investors, it's also been very good for the U.S. economy. Think of all that interests throwing, coming off of this money market funds and it's almost a percent of economy growth. Now let's look at the next couple of years, rates on cash are coming down. Now it's time to make sure you have a bond portfolio because you can get a higher returns there over time. Lower rates are typically very good for the stock market as well. As long as you have a soft landing economy, and that is actually our forcast. Historically when rates are going up fairly dramatically and then when the fed lowers them, we all think going what's next called (?) *euphemistically a* a hard landing, which is a u..sm(?) *euphemism* called recession. You're just saying you think we're having a soft landing, why do you think that this fed is so smart that they gonna be get us in a lower interest rate level without going into a recession. The truth is the soft landing is in on our awear, right? During my career ther's only have been one, in the mid 1990s. But the reason we think that we're on a path right now for a soft landing is that the economic growth remains very good and our forcast is for that momentum continuing next year. Stock markets are doing very well, creating wealth for people, consumers, and earnings are doing quite well, right? Fundamentals are really matter and stock market are gonna be up 10% or so this year. And again we see a projectory *trajectory* for that to continue next year.

But now almost 5 years later and disappointed with the results, many firms are pulling back on black focuses recruiment *recruitment* schemes and ditching *ditching* diversity, equity and inclusion back to norm(?). Some black professionals we've spoken to who asked to remain anonymous report feeling abandoned, and others say their empolyers weren't ready to welcome diverse talent, speaking of insentitive managers, and hostile working envirionments.

It will now take 50 years for the portion *proportion* of black talent in U.K. financial services to match the percentage of Black employees in the working age population. In investment banking representation at senior levels at just 0.5%, and Black talent is also leaving the city before it reaches the top jobs.

And it was here that Lan's family had a store selling cosmetics and hair acessaries. After the Vietnam war, the country unified under communism, but was financially ruined and isolated internationally. By the 1980s Vietnam was in deep poverty, and they needed to reform, by liberalising and opening up to the rest of the world, and following the footsteps of China.
