  - Dictation: There's been considerable rocket fire between Israel and Hisblind(?)*Hezbollah* Lebanon in recent days. Thousands*Dozens* of rockets have been fired into northern Israel by Halbala(?)*Hezbollah* and it's been significant damage done by Israeli strikes in Lebanon. This strategy*footage* is from? Yaroun and in the southwest*south-west *of* Lebenan? you can see buildings have been flattened in*over* a large area. 
    We've been mapping the way to the *the wider* picture too. If you focus on the region, this map is based on data from the Institute of Study of War,*.* It's up to date as of Monday morning,
    so it doesn't include the most recent strikes. It doesn't include reported strikes  xxx*.We haven't* verified them all, and they*there* maybe some we don't know about? But you can see here in pop on *purple* recent herespak(?) *Hezbollah*
    attack on Israel*.* and in red you can see Israeli strikes in Lebanon. This focuses on a few examples to show the extent of the damage you can see in Lebanon. 
    Firstly this one is from Arab Saline(?)*Arabsalim* in southern Lebanon 16 kilometers from the border of*with* Israel. We verify this footage by looking at the surrounding area and*.It* matching satellite images from 
    the for(?) *before* the rate *this raid* and building still standing in this footage. And we're confident the footage is from Tuesday morning when it was first posted online. What we *it* clearly sure *shows* is that *a* considerable level of damage.
    Let me also show you this footage from Berrod(?) *Beirut* . Israel says it's targeting hesbalad(?) *Hezbollah* 's stronghold, particular areas of weapons are been *being* stored. And this footage does appear to show secondary explosions.
    You can hear, there's already damage done, the building is on fire, and about 40 seconds into the footage which has been posted online, there's another explosion. *A* projectile flies up (?) the building, *and* that's
    lately? *likely* caused by ammunition blowing up. There are other examples like this. We're *'ve* shown *them* to experts, who see again this is likely called by ammunition exploding. With damages against the backdrop
    Israel is sending more troops into Lebanon. On Tuesday Israeli defense forces confirmed they were expanding the operations into the southwest. And like what's happening in Gaza, this is a sort of warning
    circulated by the IDF. This one in Arabic tells people in the south to be careful not to move south, and it tells many not to return to their homes for their own safety. 
    In recent months, hundreds of thousands of people in Lebanon have been displaced and much of that has been happening in the south of the country. Where we've seen a lot of the damage too.
  - Fix: Hezbollah; footage on recent herespak

  -Dictation: Why are these maps renamed in southern U.S.A. in Lebanon and Ukraine spreading online? It's all to do with a claim the white house prioritising the funding for these countries of America affected by Hurricane kalin*Katrina* and Milton. Former senator Rick Scott posted on X "If we renamed Florida and North Carolina to Lebanon and Ukraine maybe Kamala Harris would send disaster relief faster". And former President Donald Trump weighed in this claim: "They have no funds to take care of that, they have no funds, they have no workers, they have no nothing". So what are the facts? The U.S. government confirmed last week it will provide more humanitarian relief to people in Lebanon and *another* 150m dollars, and it has given a lot of money to Ukraine, around 100 billion dollars to start*since the start* a*of the* full-scale war against Russia. But Fema(?) an*the* department for responsible for responding to events in the U.S like carocaines(?)*Hurricanes* has dedicated to disaster relief budget. It said*says* it has 11 billion left of that for the rest of this year. The agency has appealed for the*/* more funding for future hurricanes a*and* warn*warned* of *a* lack of staff. But instead*it insists* it has enough resources to meet immediate needs. "I have enough funding to get through this event and support all of the needs of everyone that was impacted by Hurricane Hellin(?)*Helene* and Hurricane Milton(?) from*and* what we expect from Milton(?)". What elses*The White Houses has* pushing back on claims as*/* it *hasn't* provided funds quickly enough of*in* the aftermath *of* Hurricane Milton which delesgate*devastated*
  seperate*of several* U.S.A*U.S States*. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been provided to victims so far, and the government says billions more are*on* hand to*as* Hurricane Milton hits.
  
  -Fix: devastated 被摧毁

  -Dictation: So Donald Trump, not you Republican says he wants to seal the border, nobody in. Is that something you support? So I believe when the president says that um to secure our literal border to ensure the agenda the Americans sacrety as a nation not to ... yes yes that doesn't mean ... that means to secure the literal border. "You're seeing it in anything else". 

Even the immigration has been immigration of undocumented or legal marks has been so much harron(?) average under the Biden administration 2 milinuim(?) years compared with the Trump administration in about 300..400 thousand years. Are you blaming in that all on a bill when it is supposed to be the past what about the previous 3 years? To get to a ... to a place where we have orderly border security that we deserve it is gonna take an act of the Congress and the Congress had the bill on the table that is not locked because of one man named Donald Trump he said to blame them and I do.
