笔记内容

Indulging in desires, I am carefree,
放情纵欲任优游，
No fears ,no sorrows ,Just pure glee.
也无恐怖也无愁
In land of bliss, at the Eight Precepts,I lauth with delight,
极乐场中笑八戒
Inherent nature blooms, a tower of light.
自性具足花满楼
In the West, on the peak of Mount Lingshan.

Two men sat facing each other. Clouds billowed and the air crackled with tension.

The young monk looked up at the sky, then pressed his palms together and bowed to another monk with brows yellow. "Our masters are all here,
brother. Are you ready?"

The yellow-brow monk smiled and returned the bow . "I have been ready for some time."

The Ullambana Assembly, held once every five hundred years, had come to the stage of debate for graduating disciples.
Ullambana Assembly： 盂兰盆会

The young monk raised a hand, signaling his brother to ask the first question.

"Tell me, brother," said the yellow-brow monk, "what is the meaning of life?"

"To seek truth," replied the young monk.

"And what is truth?"

"The way all things move, the primary law of the universe."

The yellow-brow monk said nothing but brought out a flower. Its petals, first drooping, gradually unfurled in glorious bloom.
petals:花瓣
unfurled:展开

Gazing at the flower, he said, "Observe it. By following its nature, it undergoes such wonderous changes."
undergoes:经历
Indulging:放纵

翻译了 Devcon 活动的信息

At Devcon, we see many practical activities focused on Layer2, DeFi, CypherPunk, Meme, etc., but there's a lack of discussion and attention on Coordination. In today's world, where mature Web2 solutions already exist for sectors like Social and Gaming, the adoption of Web3 technologies in these areas is not necessarily essential. However, the impact of blockchain on coordination is revolutionary, as it brings unprecedented transparency, trust, and decentralization to human history for the first time. Given this context, our theme will explore both coordination and conflict. We'll draw insights from experiences, challenges, and solutions across various dimensions and fields, including but not limited to DAOs and public goods. Our aim is to analyze and inspire innovative solutions from a multidisciplinary perspective.

Chris's post mentioned the LXTalk podcast project that was halted last year and shared thoughts on restarting the show. LXDAO focuses on developing valuable projects, and the podcast is an effective way to showcase these results. By regularly updating podcast content, it can highlight project progress and innovative solutions, helping supporters and potential investors better understand LXDAO's developments. Chris suggested reducing the update frequency of LXTalk to once a month to build audience anticipation and lower related costs.
