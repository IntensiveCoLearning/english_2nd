Story 1：The owner of the HangWei Noodle Shop

`Hello everyone，I'm Jiang Yun. The owner of the HangWei Noodle Shop.`Our shop has always been **downstairs** from Alipay ’s office. We always move to **wherever** the Alipay office is . `We’ve witnessed how Alipay has grown into Ant Group`.All these years,Ant Group’s staff ordered **countless** bowls of our noodles,I can proudly say that our noodles helped feed many of their innovations and ideas.I was only 26 years old `when Alipay was founded`.At that time , my husband and I had just moved to Hangzhou for a few years.and we were still using an old-fashioned cash register.When we moved our noodle shop to the downstairs of the Alipay building, not only did we make noodles for them，we also became their “guinea pigs”。They would take all their new creations to my shop for testing. See. these are the payment tools they’d asked me to try out.`I know over 80 million businesses and 1 billion users are using Alipay`.`I never imagined that as a noodle shop owner, I can help change the world too!`

Story 2：Accessible payment experience consultant

`Many people would think that visually impaired people like us are unable to use the internet or smartphones.`**Actually** with screen-reading **software**, we can do many different things. Alipay is an example，It offers over 1000 **daily life service**s and more than 2 million **mini program**s. we can **even** say **the mobile internet** has given us **a new pair of** eyes. Back when Alipay removed the Android **version** of password keyboard reading **function**s,`I got so upset.I wrote them a complaint letter`, To my surprise, Alipay **responded** very quickly, `they fixed the problems promptly`. I **along with** two other visually impaired buddies of mine, were invited to test their beta versions and `offer suggestions on their products`.At that moment, `I felt like we were building the internet version of tactile paving together` .As I see it, Alipay is not only helping people like me who cannot see but also helping those who cannot see their ways through other challenges in their lives.For instance ,more than 70% of adults in China do not have a credit card, but now , `they can use products such as Huabei to manage their lives with more flexibility`.The threshold of wealth management was high，More than 500 million people in china have never bought any financial products，but now , even with just 1RMB ,you can invest in Yu’ebao. From zero to one, all these changes make our lives brighter and full of hope. we believe everybody can have a colorful and free-spirited digital life.

Story 3：Xianghubao

Honestly, It’s not easy being an investigator for Xianghubao.`I grew up in a rural area`.**It really is a big dea**l if you get a serious illness here.However, we need to remain unbiased.What is Xianghubao?It is a mutual aid platform.It literally means ‘help one another’. All the money put into Xianghubao is a token of goodwill from all participants and will be sent to those **who are really in need**.There are still many people out there without health protection especially in rural areas.That’s why **since** the launch of Xianghubao hundreds of millions of people have already participated. We cannot expect everything to be perfect, but one more layer of protection provides more hope. We believe by connecting with one another, we can all receive better care and support.

Story 4：Alipay loan services

Before quitting my job, I'd discussed this decision with my family several times. My wife wished for me to have a stable job ,but I always wanted to try something interesting and challenging.In our county, lots of small merchants still only accept cash payments, so I recommend them to use Alipay. No need to worry about giving change, and no need to chase down unpaid bills. Every transaction is crystal clear.If you need funding for your business later on, `you can apply for a loan on Alipay`.`And just like that ,word spread in the neighborhood that`.To get rich , ask for MaQiang.I've introduced Alipay services to hundreds of merchants in our county. I know that as of now, their are 80 million businesses using Alipay, and over 20 million small enterprises have obtained loans from MYBank.`Business has been tough for everyone since the COVID-19 pandemic`. Helping their businesses thrive is my business .We believe every small business has an equal opportunity to grow.

Story 5：AntChain

I've been working in an electronics market for 20 years, but I’ve never heard of blockchain previously .Last summer,I shipped a lot of goods without receiving any payment in advance,so I was under tremendous financial pressure.It wasn’t until later that an Ant Group staff suggested that I try AntChain.As a result, I received my payment far ahead of schedule.This truly solved my pressing needs. China Everbright Bank has teamed up with Ant Group,and laughed “Guangxintong”, a supply chain finance product based on AntChain’s Duo Chain technology.`Guangxintong aims to provide small enterprises with better financial support`. I know there are over 2000 financial institutions collaborating with Ant Group and I believe there will be more innovative financial services coming out.What a AntChain?` I don’t know how to explain it to you`.`But I do know that it's already been applied to more than 50 business use cases, such as food traceability and copyright protection.`Such technology helps small enterpreneurs like me better run our businesses.It is truly a good thing to have.We believe the development of technology makes it easy to do business anywhere.

Story 6：technology support：latest eKYC service 

During the pandemic period，it was becoming very difficult for us to pay the salaries to our workers on time.`Most of the garment workers don’t have bank accounts`,so it's difficult for them to get government subsidies.Fortunately,bKash has the latest eKYC service that allows people instantly open their accounts sitting at home or from nationwide bKash digital registration points.We have already enabled one million workers across the country to get their salaries and `helped them carry on with their basic needs of life`.`Garments industry has become the backbone of our economy`. **And we feel proud to facilitate this sector by enabling millions of people to avail a wide array of services through bKash.** Thanks to the strong technology support from Ant Group in the journey.If we can stand together ,we can make life better. We believe open collaboration will make people from different regions equally enjoy the convenience and brilliance of digital life.

Take a look at these gorgeous sweet-vetches . They're not only beautiful, but their seeds can also be sold for money.`Three years ago, I gathered five impoverished households from our village to form a co-op and we planted trees together`.Since then our lives have improved ,I’m also thinking about raising bees for some sweet vetch-honey, which might make our life even better in the near future.I heard that 550 million people are planting trees for Alipay Ant Forest.  and until now ,more than 200 million trees have already been planted .if you plant one virtual in your smartphone app. I’ll plant one real tree here.Together，we plant hope. `We believe technology is the biggest public good of our time.`

The Double Ninth Festival is a day for our grandparents in China. It is on October 11 2024 this year. Let me tell you about it. On this day, we can climb up the hills, enjoy chrysanthemums and drink wine. My grandparents always tell me "The higher you climb, the further you will stay away from disasters." And I think they're right. We can show our love and care to old people. Loving old people is a tradition in China. That is because they have more experience and they know how to help their children. So, in a family, old people are always the best teachers.

Notes:

- The Double Ninth Festival 重阳节
- grandparents 祖父母
