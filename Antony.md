First, the reading points out that Amtrak keeps losing money. If Amtrak was private, the unprofitable routes could be cut. However, the speaker says the purpose of maintaining train service by the US government is not for profit. She claims that Amtrak should serve citizens in all parts of the country including less populated areas. Therefore, Amtrak should not be sold to a private company.

Third, the article notes that train is not important in the US because it is underuse. Most of people use private car for long-distance traveling. The speaker agrees with this, but she points out that the reason is that the train system is out of date and not affordable. She takes Japan and Europe as examples, the train in those areas is convenient and affordable, so many people choose train as a transportation option. As a result, she emphasizes the US government should invest more on the train and make it popular.
