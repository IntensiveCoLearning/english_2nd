之前打卡失败，测试一下

先了解语言学习的本质，即语言学习到底是要学习什么，训练什么。
了解本人的一些有效学习方法，查看我是如何通过本质推断这个方法是否有效。
按照自己的需求定制学习方法，在日后看到某些学习方法时可以有效推断该方法是否有效。
这里举一个反例有什么相见恨晚的背单词方法？，大概思路就是 10 个随机单词一组，先大体一看，开始编故事串联起来十个单词，通过艾宾浩斯周期回顾这组单词，回顾时遮住汉语意思开始回想，如果想不起来想想小故事，通过故事来回忆起这个单词的意思。

这其实就是联想的记忆技巧，你试一下绝对也好用。但这个过程中有很多问题：

词义损失严重。 一个单词几个简单的中文释义，而且还基于部分中文释义来编造离奇小故事，会导致词义理解偏差更严重。
语料库内容不正确。 语料库你需要记忆的是 单词 -> 诸多释义、例句、声音等等，但这种方法你记住的是 单词 -> 几个释义，一个故事，故事关联的其他单词。
缺乏当前单词听力和发音的输入、锻炼。
所以这种方法不推荐使用，因为投入的成本和收获比比较低。试想：当一个老外对你说一个单词，你会用故事去联想这个单词是什么中文意思，然后再去做出反应吗？而且这个中文意思可能并不是老外想表达的意思。其次，单词你可能说起来磕磕碰碰甚至发音是错的，因为在背的过程中，你并不知道它准确的发音，也没有训练。

Nihon Hidankyo, a Japanese group of atomic bomb survivors, has won the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize.

Known as hibakusha, the survivors of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been recognised by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons.

Nobel Committee Chair Joergen Watne Frydnes said the group had "contributed greatly to the establishment of the nuclear taboo".

Mr Frydnes warned the "nuclear taboo" was now "under pressure" - and praised the group's use of witness testimony to ensure nuclear weapons must never be used again.

Founded in 1956, the organisation sends survivors around the world to share their testimonies of the "atrocious damage" and suffering caused by the use of nuclear weapons, according to its website.

The UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon says Israeli tanks forced their way into one of its positions early on Sunday morning, the latest in a series of incidents in recent days.

In a statement, the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said two Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tanks destroyed the main gate of a post in Ramyah, near the border with Israel, and "forcibly entered the position" to request it turn out its lights.

About two hours later, it said rounds were fired nearby that saw smoke enter the camp, causing 15 peacekeepers to suffer skin irritations and gastrointestinal reactions.

These incidents were "shocking violations", it said.

The statement comes after Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Unifil to move away from areas where fighting was taking place "immediately".

In a video statement issued by his office on Sunday, Benjamin Netanyahu told Unifil to get its troops "out of harm's way", claiming that their presence in the region made them "hostages of Hezbollah".

Israel has faced international condemnation for previous instances in which Unifil troops have been injured in southern Lebanon - with the IDF admitting responsibility for firing toward UN posts in some cases.

Unifil said: "For the fourth time in as many days, we remind the IDF and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and to respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times."

It described the breach of its post in Ramyah as "a further flagrant violation of international law".

Unifil added that on Saturday israeli troops had blocked them from carrying out a "critical" logistical movement near Meiss El Jebel, also near the border.

Israel has previously asked Unifil to withdraw north by 5km (3 miles) after it launched an invasion targeting the armed group Hezbollah. Unifil has so far refused that request.

Liam Payne's father has viewed tributes outside the hotel where his son died, as the star's former partner Cheryl says her son Bear has to “face the reality of never seeing his father again”.

Payne, 31, died on Wednesday when he fell from the balcony of the third-floor hotel room where he had been staying in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

In Argentina, Geoff Payne was followed by a scrum of photographers as he visited the hotel, prompting fans to shout at the press and attempt to block the building's entrance to stop them entering.

Mr Payne travelled to Buenos Aires after his son's death and the journey from his hotel to the Casa Sur hotel was broadcast on Argentine television, despite family requests for privacy.

Girls Aloud singer Cheryl, who was in a relationship with Payne from 2016 to 2018, also criticised "abhorrent" media coverage following his death.

Posting on Instagram, Cheryl said: "As I try to navigate this earth shattering event, and work through my own grief at this indescribably painful time, I'd like to kindly remind everyone that we have lost a human being."

Along with her statement Cheryl shared a black and white image of Payne with their son Bear and a broken heart emoji.


Payne's sister, Ruth Gibbins, described him as her "best friend" in an emotional Instagram post on Saturday, in which she vowed the family will "take care of Bear".

"My brain is struggling to catch up with what's happening and I don't understand where you've gone," she added.

Cheryl also said she was troubled her seven-year-old son could access "abhorrent reports and media exploitation" and she cannot protect him from it in the future.

“What is troubling my spirit the most is that one day Bear will have access to the abhorrent reports and media exploitation we have seen in the past two days," she added.

“I am begging you to consider what use some of these reports are serving, other than to cause further harm to everyone left behind picking up the pieces.

"Before you leave comments or make videos, ask yourself if you would like your own child or family to read them."

Ending her statement, the 41-year-old urged people to give Payne “the little dignity he has left in the wake of his death to rest in some peace at last”.
